# hla_campaign_plus
These are prefabs and associated files that were used in the campaign_plus addon

How to use:
Drag the "maps", "models", "resourcemanifests", "soundevents", and "sounds" folders into your addon folder in the content directory
"steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\content\hlvr_addons\YOUR ADDON NAME HERE"


For the vscripts folder, place the files into your addon folder in the game directory
"steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\game\hlvr_addons\YOUR ADDON NAME HERE\scripts"


In order for sounds to work go to your asset browser and recompile "campaign_plus_soundevents.vsndevts"


You should be all set to use these prefabs in your own maps!

If you end up using some of these prefabs in your map please credit me
